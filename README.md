## Reporting Bugs & Making Feature Requests

If you would like to report an issue or share a feature request, please create a Github [Issue](https://github.com/mymonero/monero-web-js/issues) on this project.

If you're reporting a bug, be sure to include all information which we would need to reproduce the issue, such as the operating system and app version on which you saw the bug, and the steps you took, if you can tell. 

Please don't use the Issues tracker for general support or inquiries. You can also [contact us](https://mymonero.com/support) directly.

## Testing

Please submit any bugs as Issues unless they have already been reported.

Suggestions and feedback are very welcome!


## Contributing

If you have an improvement to the codebase and would like to have your code shipped in the production MyMonero app, please submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/), even if it's still a WIP. We try to credit all contributors in app release notes.

* Merging PRs which involve integrating with any third-party services will require discussion and agreement.  

* We reserve the right to refuse to merge any PRs, such as those which introduce breaking changes.

The maintainer enjoys collaborating with volunteer contributors to the MyMonero apps over IRC private message and the #mymonero room on freenode.net (Come say hello!), so PR'd submissions do not have to be at all complete or perfect on their first submission. (To submit a draft PR for review, simply mark it as '[DO NOT MERGE]')

There's also an icebox of ideas, features, improvements, known issues, and other todos waiting to be knocked out which are kept in the [Issues](https://github.com/mymonero/monero-app-js/issues) tracker.
